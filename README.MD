# Eat Da Burger!

In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The App was deployed on Heroku. https://young-river-36039.herokuapp.com/


### How the app works:

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Each burger in the devoured area has a `Eat Again!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the left side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.

### How I built the app:
